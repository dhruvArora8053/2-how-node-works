    super();
  }

const myEmitter = new Sales();

//1. so remeber that event emitters can emit named events and we can then subscribe to these events so basically listen to them and then react accordingly so it's a bit like setting up an eventListener on a DOM element for ex for clicking on a button
myEmitter.on("newSale", () => {
  console.log("There was a new sale!");
});

//3. let's add another one, one of the nice things about these event emitters is that we can actually set up multiple listeners for the same event:
myEmitter.on("newSale", () => {
  console.log("Customer name: Jonas");
});

myEmitter.on("newSale", (stock) => {
  console.log(`There are now ${stock} items left in stock.`);
});

myEmitter.emit("newSale", 9);
//2. so we want to emit an event called newSale and using the example of clicking on a button, this .emit here is as if we were clicking on the button and so now we have to set up these listeners, look above
